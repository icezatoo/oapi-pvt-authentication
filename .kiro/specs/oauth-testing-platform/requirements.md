# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a comprehensive OAuth testing web platform that allows developers to configure, test, and validate OAuth flows for multiple providers (Paotang and Nextpass) across different environments. The platform will support dynamic provider configuration, environment-specific settings, and real-time OAuth flow testing with token validation capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Environment Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure different environments (SIT, UAT, PRD) for OAuth testing, so that I can test OAuth flows across different deployment stages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display environment selection options for SIT, UAT, and PRD
2. WHEN an environment is selected THEN the system SHALL load environment-specific configurations
3. WHEN switching environments THEN the system SHALL persist the current environment selection in local storage
4. IF no environment is selected THEN the system SHALL default to SIT environment

### Requirement 2: OAuth Provider Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure OAuth client settings for each provider, so that I can test different OAuth configurations dynamically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring a provider THEN the system SHALL allow input of clientId, clientSecret, callbackUrl, authUrl, tokenUrl, and userInfoUrl
2. WHEN saving provider configuration THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields are present
3. WHEN loading provider configuration THEN the system SHALL display current settings for Paotang and Nextpass providers
4. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL display validation errors with specific field requirements

### Requirement 3: Dynamic Provider Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to switch between OAuth providers and add new providers dynamically, so that I can test multiple OAuth implementations without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL read provider configurations from a config file
2. WHEN selecting a provider THEN the system SHALL load provider-specific OAuth settings
3. WHEN adding a new provider THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of all OAuth parameters
4. WHEN removing a provider THEN the system SHALL confirm the action and update the configuration

### Requirement 4: Authentication Settings Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure authentication settings per provider, so that I can test different OAuth authentication parameters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring authentication settings THEN the system SHALL allow setting ACR values for each provider
2. WHEN configuring authentication settings THEN the system SHALL allow setting Prompt values (none, login) for each provider
3. WHEN saving authentication settings THEN the system SHALL validate the configuration format
4. IF authentication settings are missing THEN the system SHALL use default values

### Requirement 5: Permissions and Scopes Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure OAuth scopes for each provider, so that I can test different permission levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring scopes THEN the system SHALL allow adding multiple scope values for each provider
2. WHEN saving scopes THEN the system SHALL validate scope format and requirements
3. WHEN loading scopes THEN the system SHALL display current scope configuration for each provider
4. IF no scopes are configured THEN the system SHALL allow OAuth flow with default scopes

### Requirement 6: Deep Link Authentication Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test different authentication methods per provider, so that I can validate QR code and app-to-app authentication flows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting Paotang provider THEN the system SHALL support both QR code and app-to-app authentication
2. WHEN selecting Nextpass provider THEN the system SHALL support app-to-app authentication only
3. WHEN initiating QR code authentication THEN the system SHALL generate and display a QR code with OAuth parameters
4. WHEN initiating app-to-app authentication THEN the system SHALL generate deep link URLs for mobile app redirection

### Requirement 7: OAuth Flow Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test complete OAuth flows and validate received tokens, so that I can ensure OAuth implementation correctness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking OAuth test button THEN the system SHALL initiate OAuth flow with configured provider
2. WHEN receiving authorization code THEN the system SHALL exchange it for access token
3. WHEN receiving access token THEN the system SHALL test API calls with the token
4. WHEN API calls succeed THEN the system SHALL display response data and token validation results
5. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL display error details and troubleshooting information
6. IF token is invalid THEN the system SHALL display token validation errors with specific reasons

### Requirement 8: Configuration Persistence and Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want my configurations to be saved and restored, so that I don't lose my testing setup between sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN saving configuration THEN the system SHALL persist settings to local storage
2. WHEN loading the application THEN the system SHALL restore previous configuration settings
3. WHEN exporting configuration THEN the system SHALL generate downloadable JSON file
4. WHEN importing configuration THEN the system SHALL validate and load configuration from JSON file

### Requirement 9: Real-time OAuth Response Handling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see real-time OAuth responses and token details, so that I can debug OAuth implementation issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OAuth flow completes THEN the system SHALL display authorization code, access token, and refresh token
2. WHEN tokens are received THEN the system SHALL decode and display JWT token contents
3. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL display request/response details in real-time
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log and display detailed error information with timestamps
